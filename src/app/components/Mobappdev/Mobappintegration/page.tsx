      "Third-party app integration refers to the process of integrating other applications into a website or app. Integrating services enhances connectivity, such that users can move from one page to another on their device without exiting. It is very crucial especially when a business wants to incorporate new features on its product or even on a website as they need not start creating these features de novo. That is why, a website can implement a payment gateway like PayPal or Stripe, or a third-party service like Google Maps. It does assist firms in cutting down on time, and money, while at the same time enhancing the features and options for its users. Third-party integration can also aid in enhancing the end user’s experience by supplying additional data or functions that are not offered within the primary site or application.",
